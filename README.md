# Tools and Helpers for Lazy People

## About this Repo

This repo contains helper scripts and tools of varying size and complexity that I've written for various things that really didn't need automated away (but were anyway).

There's a decent chance that something you see in here is redundant or unnecessary to the gods of the CLI world. Unfortunately, if that's you, I'm not you. You can walk away now and choose enlightenment, or you can stay and balk at the glory of my misguided attempts to make my digital life easier. 

The choice is yours really.

## Quick Contents

## Why

Because what's the harm?
